# Iris Dataset Classification and Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the classification of the Iris dataset using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and a Neural Network implemented in Keras.

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
